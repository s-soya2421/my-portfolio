## Concept

A workflow foundation where AI agents (Claude, etc.) and human developers collaborate to deliver efficient, high-quality development. Through text-based design management and automated quality checks, the goal is to speed up delivery while avoiding knowledge silos.

## In-Progress Considerations

- **Standardizing agent instructions**: Use AGENTS.md and claude.md to clarify AI behavior rules and keep output quality consistent.
- **Automated quality checks**: Integrate lint/test/security checks into the CI/CD pipeline to reduce human error.
- **Observability**: Visualize development processes with OpenTelemetry and automate bottleneck detection.
- **Documentation-driven development**: Build a workflow centered on OVERVIEW.md to minimize drift between specs and implementation.

## Notes

As a personal project, I am exploring the best process for collaborating with AI. By combining pnpm-based dependency management and Markdown-driven documentation, I maintain a lightweight, reproducible environment while applying a Human-in-the-Loop mindset to balance quality and automation.

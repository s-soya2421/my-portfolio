## Concept

A community where people who want to build strength training habits and coaches who want to gather teammates can easily share progress. I am designing a simple mix of training logs and social features so daily reflection feels natural and sustainable.

## Current Focus

- **Information architecture**: Organize posts, exercises, sessions, and rankings, and build APIs that minimize data fetches for each use case.
- **Experience feel**: Use the Edge Runtime for lightweight responses and Vercel OG for media generation to make the feed easy to read.
- **Development flow**: Combine Supabase Studio with Prisma schema generation and automate release flows in GitHub Actions to keep schema and types in sync.

## Progress & Learnings

- The fast decision-making speed of solo development works well with managing UI mocks and production code in the same repository.
- Realtime features need fallbacks for unstable networks, so I switched to a phased rollout approach.
- For community design, I hypothesize that the quality of "celebrating achievements" messages matters more than heavy gamification for retention.

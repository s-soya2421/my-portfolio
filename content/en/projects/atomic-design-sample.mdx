## Background

Atomic Design is easy to understand conceptually, but deciding how to split components can feel subjective in real projects. I created a small React sample to make the granularity differences easy to scan at a glance.

## Goal

- Make the relationship between Atoms, Molecules, Organisms, and Pages visually obvious
- Offer a rough sense of responsibility boundaries at each layer

## Repository

The implementation lives here. Hope it helps.

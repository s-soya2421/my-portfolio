## TL;DR

- In Nuxt 3 + CloudFront setups, `Failed to load chunk` occurred sporadically and hydration failed, leading to 500s.
- Crawlers (Googlebot/Bingbot) performed delayed rendering and referenced old bundles, causing 404s for new deploy chunks.
- Tightened `routeRules` page caching and set CloudFront `_nuxt/*` TTL to 60 days to stabilize chunks.
- Nuxt 3.17 added patches for crawler delay; errors dropped further, but continuous monitoring is still needed with frequent releases.

## Nuxt 3 SSR x CloudFront x Chunk Errors

In a Nuxt 3 SSR app behind CloudFront, this error appeared intermittently:

> Failed to load chunk XXXX

The browser could not fetch JS chunks referenced in the SSR HTML, hydration failed, and the app returned 500 errors. Alerts tended to spike when traffic surged.

## Cause

The likely cause: crawlers like Googlebot and Bingbot rendered pages late, while keeping bundle information from weeks ago. When they hit the latest deploy, chunk requests 404.

Vercel CTO wrote about this time gap between crawler rendering and the latest deploy, leading to failed resource downloads:

- [About Skew Protection](https://vercel.com/docs/skew-protection)

## Mitigation Steps

- Explicit cache control per page using `routeRules`, with `no-cache, must-revalidate`.
- Set CloudFront `_nuxt/*` TTL to 60 days to avoid chunk swapping issues.
- Strengthened bot request headers to reduce fetch failures even when older versions are referenced.

## Results and Next Steps

- Before mitigation, over 100 errors per day; after, down to 0-3.
- It has been less than a month since the change, so monitoring continues while crawlers may still hold old versions.

## Later Update

A few months later, Nuxt 3.17 shipped a patch for delayed crawler rendering, and `Failed to load chunk` errors almost disappeared.

Still, products with short release cycles can never fully eliminate the risk of crawlers referencing old chunks. Cache control and monitoring remain essential to detect and respond before users are affected.

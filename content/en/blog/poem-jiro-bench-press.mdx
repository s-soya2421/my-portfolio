## Starting in a Pressure Valley

Mind and body felt like lead. The pressure chart just kept sliding down, and even opening the IDE evaporated my energy. Caffeine and stretching did nothing, so I decided today was a day to borrow some momentum.

## Gear Up with Jiro

First stop: Jiro ramen, garlic max. Steam, pork fat, and the call-and-response ordering ritual told my stomach, "We are burning today's calories today." By the time I finished the soup, about half my CPU came back online.

## New PR: 140kg Bench :)

Then straight to the gym. Careful warm-up sets, more and more plates on the rack. I set my scapula, locked my grip, held my breath, and pushed through. Touch at 140kg, finish, success.

The moment I racked the bar, the sluggishness turned into a promise of soreness, and the fog in my head lifted.

## Steak + Sauna to Finish

No reason to skip protein, so I grabbed 300g of lean steak on the way home. Three sauna rounds and a cold plunge later, low pressure debugged. My engine restarted from deep inside, and I finally felt like typing again.

## Sometimes Force Wins

Elegant workflows and automation matter, of course. But the final move to flip a hopeless day can be raw force. In programming too, there are moments where "just push through and move forward" is the right call, and the energy you gain feeds the next careful implementation. Today was fully brute-force mode, and I am fine with that.

## Note

Tomorrow is probably all muscle soreness (^_^)...

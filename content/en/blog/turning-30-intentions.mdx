The beginning of 2026. Since this is the year I turn 30, I took a quick inventory of my life pillars. Leaving this here as a short, long-form memo.

## TL;DR

- My pillars are integrity, hands-on action, and curiosity.
- Grow while giving back to family, friends, and society through actions, not just words.

---

## Life Pillars I Want to Keep

- Be sincere and align words with actions.
- For the people in front of me, move my hands, not just my mouth.
- Enjoy change and keep curiosity alive.

### A bit more detail

- Keep baseline habits for sleep, food, and exercise to avoid breaking down.
- Reserve time each week for learning and making, and keep a sustainable pace.
- Avoid overloading on information or schedules, and intentionally make room for recovery and refresh.

## How I Want to Move Forward

Starting from this inventory, I want to grow another level as an engineer and as a person. When it comes to giving back to family, friends, and those who supported me, I do not want to stop at words of thanks. I want to return value through outcomes and actions, and become someone who can support others in turn.

And to the society and environment that raised me, I want to keep giving back in small but concrete ways. Share what I learn, publish what I make, and make the spaces I am part of a little better. My 30s will be built through that steady accumulation.
